NOW.\",\n          \"Master craftsman, Christopher Nolan - probably the best blockbuster director out there (along with Ridley Scott) - returns to good old fashioned no-CGI drama, where tension comes from words spoken, and how people react to them. There are no chases, no shoot-outs , death defying stunts or explosions.... wait, actually there is one explosion. I don't know how they made those scenes without CGI, but it's technical achievement for sure.All shot in 70mm IMAX this is beautiful film. And the lead cast - all seasoned actors - do a terrific job.My only gripe is that it's a tad too long. The final act could/should have been trimmed. But it's still the best movie I have seen this year.I strongly recommend to watch this on an IMAX screen before it's taken down in a month or so.\",\n          \"One of the most anticipated films of the year for many people, myself included, Oppenheimer largely delivers. Much of it's great. I feel like I loved two of its three hours, and liked the other hour.... but it's that fact that stops me from adoring the entire thing. I know with Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, that clicked on a second watch, so maybe Oppenheimer will need one too. That being said, I don't feel the need to rush out and see it again too soon, because it was a long and exhausting film.But in many ways, I can't deny it was an exceptionally well made one. It looks and sounds as amazing as you'd expect, feeling as though it accurately captures the time period it's set in, and containing amazing sound design and one of the year's best scores so far. Every performance is good to great, but the film belongs to Cillian Murphy, and I feel like he's the lead actor to beat at this stage, if we're talking (early) awards consideration.The film's at its best when it focuses on being a psychological thriller featuring a famous historical figure, and at one point, it even turns into a psychological horror film. There's one sequence in here involving a speech that's particularly terrifying. It also manages to have some very suspenseful moments, even though its story is commonly known history at this point.I did really feel the length in the final hour, though, and maybe I wish that final act had been more of an extended epilogue, rather than a whole third of the movie. I currently feel as though I would've loved Oppenheimer more had it been 2.5 hours instead of 3, but nothing about it was bad by any means; just a little patience testing (this is very subjective - I remember feeling like the similarly long Babylon totally justified its runtime, though others didn't feel that way).I'm left feeling like I watched a film that wasn't a slam dunk, but was incredible for more of its runtime than it wasn't. And that's still worth celebrating, and makes Oppenheimer worth seeing in cinemas for sure.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Positive\",\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Since these characteristics are good indicators of home values, correlation analysis identifies features with a strong correlation to the target variable, such as \"OverallQual\" (overall material and finish quality), \"GrLivArea\" (above ground living area), and \"GarageArea\" (size of the garage). To reduce bias and boost accuracy, data cleaning entails deleting features that have a lot of missing values or little variance. The most influential features for the regression model are chosen with the aid of feature importance analysis approaches like tree-based models."

The average squared difference between expected and actual prices is measured by the Mean Squared Error (MSE), with smaller values denoting greater performance. Lower RMSE values are desired. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of MSE and represents the model's prediction error in the same units as the target variable. The R-squared (R^2) statistic quantifies the percentage of the variation in home values that can be attributed to the features; values near 1 suggest a well-fitting model. Last but not least, the Percentage Difference determines the precise gap between expected and actual prices, offering a useful indicator of how well the model predicts home prices.\n"

In general, natural language understanding tasks are where it shines.

This method offers a respectable level of accuracy in sentiment analysis in a fast and effective manner.Overall, DistilBERT's balance of performance and efficiency makes it a suitable choice for the task at hand.\n"
